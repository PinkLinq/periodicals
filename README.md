# Periodicals

A cycle tracking application designed for the privacy minded individual. 

## Purpose 

Periodicals is designed to provide an open source, security-centric, zero-trust approach to tracking biometric data while providing an easy and forensically sound method for data destruction, meeting or exceeding the strictest of privacy laws.

## Platform

We're targeting a decentralized storage design utilizing cross-platform languages and tooling, allowing application users to export, import, share, or destroy their data on demand. Application support is targeted for iOS, Android, Linux, PC, and Mac.
